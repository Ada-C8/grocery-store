=begin
Create a Grocery module which will contain an Order class and any future grocery store logic.

Create an Order class which should have the following functionality:

A new order should be created with:
an ID, read-only
a collection of products and their cost
zero products is permitted
you can assume that there is only one of each product
A total method which will calculate the total cost of the order by:
summing up the products
adding a 7.5% tax
ensure the result is rounded to two decimal places
An add_product method which will take in two parameters, product name and price, and add the data to the product collection
It should return true if the item was successfully added and false if it was not
